# Hi, I'm Steph! :wave:


## :hibiscus: About Me

I'm a full-stack senior engineer currently working at American Express. I love working on responsive websites, improving accessibility, and creating A/B tests. I have been an engineer for about 8 years and I've recently started dappling with open-source, which I'm absolutely loving. I look forward to progressing within my field as I continue to learn and grow.
